# Singular Value Decomposition
## Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a way to decompose a matrix into three simpler matrices, which can be useful for various purposes, such as dimensionality reduction, noise reduction, and data compression. 

## Applications of SVD
#### 1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
#### 2. Recommender Systems
#### 3. Image Compression
#### 4. Solving Linear Systems
